# Smart Contract Security Journey
This repository documents my learning journey in Smart Contract Security, starting with [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), a series of security-focused challenges. For each challenge, I have created detailed audit reports, showcasing identified vulnerabilities and potential mitigations.
